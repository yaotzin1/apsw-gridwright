## 2025-05-18 - Formula Injection in Export and Clipboard Headers
**Vulnerability:** Column headers in CSV export and HTML clipboard payload were exempted from formula defusing (`escapeFormulas` was passed as `false` for headers in `formatCsv` and `formatHtml`), allowing dynamic column headers starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` to execute as formulas in spreadsheet software.
**Learning:** Export logic previously assumed only data rows contained untrusted input, overlooking that column headers can also be user-supplied or data-driven (e.g., custom query schemas, dynamic CSV templates).
**Prevention:** Always apply uniform formula defusing rules across both table headers and body cells when serializing tabular data for spreadsheet applications.
